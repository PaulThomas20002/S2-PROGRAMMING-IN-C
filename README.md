Introduction to structured approach to programming, Flow chart Algorithms, Pseudo code (bubble
sort, linear search - algorithms and pseudocode)<br>

Module 2<br>
Program Basics<br>
Basic structure of C program: Character set, Tokens, Identifiers in C, Variables and Data Types ,
Constants, Console IO Operations, printf and scanf
Operators and Expressions: Expressions and Arithmetic Operators, Relational and Logical Operators,
Conditional operator, size of operator, Assignment operators and Bitwise Operators. Operators
Precedence<br>
Control Flow Statements: If Statement, Switch Statement, Unconditional Branching using goto
statement, While Loop, Do While Loop, For Loop, Break and Continue statements.(Simple programs
covering control flow)<br>

<br>
Module 4<br>
Working with functions<br>
Introduction to modular programming, writing functions, formal parameters, actual parameters
Pass by Value, Recursion, Arrays as Function Parameters structure, union, Storage Classes, Scope
and life time of variables, simple programs using functions<br>
